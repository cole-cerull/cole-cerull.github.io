							Hello, my name is Cole Cerull, and I am a recent graduate from The University of Colorado Boulder, where I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a minor in Geography.
							My fascination with understanding how things work began early, but it was truly ignited when I rebuilt my old Volkswagen. During this project, I spent considerable time with the engine control unit, essentially the brain of the engine. This experience not only deepened my interest in computers but also led me to work for a company specializing in reprogramming these units to enhance performance and efficiency.
							
							In high school, I turned my passion for automotive modifications into a successful business, providing customized solutions for car enthusiasts. This venture honed my skills in both technical and sales/management aspects, as I worked closely with clients to understand their needs and deliver exceptional results. I offered many services, from basic maintenance to installing aftermarket parts, but the largest sector of my business was reprogramming ECUs as a vendor for Boost Dynamic Tuning.
							
							Recently, my career focus has expanded to cybersecurity and networking, inspired by an introductory course in the field. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with various networking systems and technologies. For instance, I purchased an old Lenovo ThinkServer, installed a Debian-based Linux server, and have been using it for tasks such as media serving and DNS sinkholing, with more projects on the horizon. These experiences have solidified my interest in transitioning from automotive to cybersecurity.
							
							Outside of my professional interests, I am an avid outdoorsman. You can find me hitting the slopes during winter or mountain biking and camping in the summer. I also have a passion for fabrication, including welding, machining, and 3D printing. I love using these skills to work on my cars and develop new parts for them.
							
							I thrive on collaboration and enjoy working with others to solve complex problems. My diverse background in automotive technology, cybersecurity, and hands-on fabrication, combined with my strong interpersonal and sales skills, makes me well-equipped to tackle new challenges and contribute effectively to any team.
