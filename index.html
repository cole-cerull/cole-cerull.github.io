							Hello, my name is Cole Cerull and I am currently a student The University of Colorado at Boulder. I am perusing a bachelors in computer science with a minor in geography and I plan to graduate in December 2023.
							I have always been interested in the way that things work and loved to learn about new things. The thing that jumpstarted my interest for computers was while rebuilding my old Volkswagen, I spent a lot of time 
							with the engine control unit that is basically the brain of an engine. I was so intrigued with how it worked and continued to learn more. For a few years I worked for a company where we would reprogram these engine
							control units with high performance calibrations to squeeze extra power and efficiency out of them. As we stray from traditional internal combustion powered vehicles into electric, I'm excited to see where things 
							will go for the automotive aftermarket. 
						</p>
						<p>
							More recently through an intro to cybersecurity course I have fallen in love with the field an networking. In my freetime recently I have been experimenting with different networking systems and other technologies.
							I purchased an old Lenovo ThinkServer that came without any drives, I spun up a linux server with a debian distrobution. I use it for multiple tasks at the moment such as a media server and DNS sinkhole with more projects planned.
							Through my class and personal projects my focus for job fields has changed from automotive to cybersecurity.
						</p>
						<p>
							Outside of school I am an avid outdoorsman, You can catch me hitting the slopes all winter and fishing and camping in the summer. When I'm not enjoying the outdoors I 
							also enjoy fabrication; welding, machining, 3d printing and using those skills to work on my cars and develop new parts for them.
