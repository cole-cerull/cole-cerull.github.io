									<h1>Mountain Bike Fork Seal<br />
									Installation Tool</h1>
									<!-- <p>text</p> -->
								</header>

								<p>As an avid mountain biker my bike tends to get a fair amount of use and ridden quite hard. Just like a car, if you want something to stay running in peak performance and ensure longevity/reliability, performing maintainance is key. One part that takes a lot of abuse on a bike is the suspension components, when ridding technical terrain and jumping the fork takes a lot of impacts and abuse. Therefore, the manufacture FOX reccomends regularly servicing it.</p>
								<p>When servicing the lower legs, replacing the seals for the stantions is sometimes required. These seals perform a vital purpose, keepigng the oil in and keeping contaminants such as dirt and dust from getting in. For installing these seals correctly a special tool is best to use. The seals are flangeless and therfore could easily be installed at an angle or too deep.</p>
								<p>Instead of spending $30 to buy the tool from the manufacturer I figured I could make one myself. There are multiple features that are needed for this tool to be effective. First it must have a shaft that is the same diameter of the stantions so that it can align perfectly with the bushings in the lower part of the fork. Second the seal itself needs to fit inside of the tool so that only the outer part of the seal is being pressed on. And third it needs to have a ridge on the outside so the seal will be pressed in flush and not too deep. </p>
								<p>
									Taking insperation from other designs I saw online, I went into Fusion360 to design the part. Since accurate dimmensions were important I made sure to measure everything with a set of calipers.
