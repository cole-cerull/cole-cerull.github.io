								<p>
									As my interest in automobiles and my skillset grew, I began expanding from working on my own cars to working on others' vehicles. While still in high school, I started with basic tasks for friends' cars, such as installing subwoofers and performing routine maintenance. Over time, I progressed to more advanced work, including installing performance suspension components and engine parts. During this period, I connected with Boost Dynamic Tuning, where I learned to reflash engine control units, remove immobilizers, and perform data logging. This partnership allowed me to become a distributor for their aftermarket ECU software, and thus, CTC Performance was born!
								</p>
								<p>
									I primarily marketed my business through my Facebook page and later used ads on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace as they became popular. I operated this business from 2016 until 2020.
								</p>
								<p>
									This experience taught me a great deal about cars, but more importantly, it honed my people skills. Many customers' cars arrived with pre-existing issues that were exacerbated when pushing more power with the performance software. I often had to diagnose problems in front of the customer, explain the issues in basic terms, and outline the steps to fix them. Frequently, cars would develop problems after the software installation, not due to the software itself, but because many of these vehicles were older, high-mileage Volkswagens that were often not well-maintained. The added strain on components would highlight minor issues, making them more severe.

								<p>
									Managing disgruntled customers who wanted to blame their car problems on me was a significant challenge that I learned to handle effectively. To mitigate potential conflicts, I implemented liability waivers that customers were required to sign before any work was performed on their vehicles.
								</p>
								<p>
									Working with Boost Dynamic Tuning also led to a summer internship in Saginaw, Michigan, where I gained further insight into business development and operations.
								</p>
								<p>
									Overall, starting and running this business helped me sharpen my technical knowledge, enhance my business management skills, and, most importantly, improve my ability to communicate and manage customer relationships.
